## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, part-1
This lab’s part -1 was fun because these were the first things I learned about coding, from using git clone to git push. This was where we learned to print our names. This was fun because despite how frustrating in the beginning from being confused, at the end of the lab I understood how to use the commands we learned in the lecture into the lab. At the end of the lab, I felt happy to have learned what the commands git status, git clone, git commit -m “” and git push do.

Lab 2, part-1 
Lab 2 was my second favorite lab because in part-1 this was where we got to learn how to initialize variables with names. We learned to print sentences of what computers can do. It was fun to learn how to print things into the terminal using std::cout and learning how std::string is used for words. It was also fun learning and figuring out how to use these commands as we coded.

Lab 5, part-1
Lab 5 part -1 was another of my favorite labs because we learned how to multiply two variables together. We used the formula area equals length times width to find the area of the rectangle. I also enjoyed seeing how when we followed each step, we were able to find the area of the rectangle we created at the end.
